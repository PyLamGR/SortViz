# SortViz

SortViz is an educational tool, developed in order to help students to understand how sorting alogirithms work. The whole tool contains three scripts, the visualization script, the sorting algorithms script and the main script, bearing the name of the project itself.  

## Prerequisites

When using the tool, your computer must have the following elements:
1.  a version of **Python 3.6**
2.  the python module **Matplotlib**, which can be downloaded by typing

```
pip3 install Matplotlib
```

3.  the python Graphical User Interface module, **PyQt5**: 

```
pip3 install PyQt5
```

Note: If you have anaconda installed, you have no need downloading!

## Installation

This tool is a console script, which means that it does not need any installation

## Running the script

All you have to do is to open the directory containing the scripts, and run the command

```
python SortViz_main_.py
```

Then you just wait for the GUI window to pop up, and you are ready!

Note: All aforementioned scripts must reside in the same directory

## Running Instructions

When the GUI window pops up, you will, hopefully, understand immediatelly how to use the script. There are three basic buttons, which also show certain functionallity messages when placed under the mouse cursor!

## Built with
